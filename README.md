IDS_COVID-19
==============================

### Introduction to Data Science project on COVID-19 dataset @ TU_Kaiserslautern SS20

The goal of the project is to understand the data science at professional level, to create a dynamic dashboard for visualization, and for final submission of the Enterprise Data Science class at TU Kaiserslautern by developing a COVID-19 prototype.

In the project, standard work flow known as CRISP-DM, which is normally followed at industry-level is followed:
- Business understanding
- Data understanding
- Data preparation
- Modeling
- Deployment   

Data is collected by different methods. However, all the datasets are not used for modeling.
Two models are created by using various mathemaical transformations: 
1. To calculate doubling rate for original data and filterd data.
2. SIR compartmental model. 

Also, two dynamic dashboards are created to visualize the models given above.
